## Chai Design System
---

What is a design system:

To learn more about this look at this [Why Design Systems](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/whyDesignSystems.md) -  Explains the need for a design system in the context of compose.

## About Chai

Chai is swahili word for tea.
This is the droidconKE design system.

Link to the [design doc](https://xd.adobe.com/view/eb1ed4ed-fd4d-4ba2-b2f7-a91c7379a022-be4d/screen/cfea72b5-9007-4335-ae86-9162594c094f/)

This Project shows how you can use this design system in a multi module app monoRepo set up.


### Structure Of Chai's Design System Project,

The Chai Design System Project Architecture is captured in detail:
1. [Why Design Systems](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/whyDesignSystems.md) -  Explains the need for a design system in the context of compose.
2. [Architecture](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/architecture.md) -  The architecture of the project
3. [Chai Design System Architecture](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/chaiArchitecture.md) -  The architecture of the design system
4. [buildlogic](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/buildlogic.md) -  Handles how we build the app wiyth gradle, ditches the build src in favour of convengion polugins.
5. [chaiLinter](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/chaiLinter.md) -  Explains the design system linter
6. [Atoms](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/atoms.md) - Explains the atoms in the design system

## Implementing Chai

To Implement chai,

See the example implementation that  exists by running [chaidemo] that contains the various implementations of the elements of the design system.

### [Running Project]
Known issue with gradle:
- If you run into an error when building project, ist probably a false negative.
- Run(Or just press green play icon on android studio from the left here:
 `./gradlew sync` and output complete html report should not display errors then
  `./gradlew tasks` to see a list of tasks you can run from the root of the project 

or just press the gradle icon with the downward arrow at the top right of android studio to sync project with gradle files and you should be ok.
